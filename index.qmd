## About me

Hello, my name is Rachel Ki, and I am current 4th year undergraduate for Statistics and Data Science at UCLA.
I am interested in data analysis especially in the biotechnology industry. Currently working as a Bioinformatics researcher at Park Lab, where I am analyzing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithms.

Attached is my current [CV](DOCS/Resume_Rachel_Ki.pdf "CV")
